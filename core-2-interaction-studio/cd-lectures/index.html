    <h2>CD Lecture 1 Response</h2>

    <p>
        After watching Elaineâ€™s lecture, I feel as though her insight into culture and the world of design was a valuable concept to learn now, when looking ahead to the remaining years of college, and into the future of a design occupation. I think that the idea to include culture more into the field of design, where cultures would be able to build upon the already existing, predominantly white and male, concepts of design seemed like an objective way to have inclusivity take a more significant role in design. I think time will be the most important factor in having this process evolve, as was said in the lecture, the student body, especially at Parsons is more diverse than ever, and I feel that once the students enter into the design field, they will be able to share personal perspectives of culture, and integrate it into design, weather that be personal or professional. Elaine voiced her struggles with being able to show culture expression through designs in the professional side of the field, but I think since these issues with the current landscape of design are being taught to us currently, we will hopefully be around like-minded people who are eager to have personal and cultural stories be told through their design work; and if not in our generation, then we would take on the role of designers who seek for more representation in our own work and the work of our contemporaries.
