<p>What had periods to do with it<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span> Inevitably<span class="comma">,</span> no matter how completely I had to have writing go on, physically one had to again and again stop sometim<span class="comma">,</span> and if one had to again and again stop sometime<span class="comma">,</span> and if one had to again and again stop sometime<span class="comma">,</span> then periods had to exist. Beside<span class="comma">,</span> I had always like the look of periods and I liked what they did. Stopping sometime did not really keep one from going on, it was nothing that interfered, it was only something that happened, and as it happened as a perfectly natural happening, I did not believe in periods and I used them. I really never stopped using them.

    <br><br>Beside that<span class="comma">,</span> periods might later come to have a life of their own<span class="comma">,</span> to commence breaking up things in arbitrary ways<span class="semicolon-replace">,</span><span class="semicolon">;</span> that has happened lately with me in a poem I have written called Winning His Way, later I will read you a little of it. By the time I had written this poem about three years ago<span class="comma">,</span> periods had come to have<span class="comma">,</span> for me<span class="comma">,</span> completely a life of their own. They could begin to act as they thought best<span class="comma">,</span> and one might interrupt one’s writing with them<span class="comma">,</span> that is<span class="comma">,</span> not really interrupt one’s writing with them<span class="comma">,</span> but one could come to stop<span class="comma">,</span> arbitrarily stop at times<span class="comma">,</span> in one’s writing<span class="comma">,</span> and so they could be used<span class="comma">,</span> and you could use them<span class="period">.</span> Periods could come to exist in this way and they could come in this way to have a life of their own. They did not serve you in any servile way<span class="comma">,</span> as commas and colons and semi-colons do. Yes you do feel what I mean<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span>
    
    <br><br>Periods have a life of their own<span class="comma">,</span> a necessity of their own<span class="comma">,</span> a feeling of their own<span class="comma">,</span> a time of their own. And that feeling<span class="comma">,</span> that life<span class="comma">,</span> that necessity<span class="comma">,</span> that time<span class="comma">,</span> can express itself in an infinite variety<span class="semicolon">;</span> that is the reason that I have always remained true to periods<span class="comma">,</span> so much so that as I say recently I have felt that one could need them more than one had ever needed them.
