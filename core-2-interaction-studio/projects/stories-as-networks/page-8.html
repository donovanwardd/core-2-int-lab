<p>When it gets really difficult<span class="comma">,</span> you want to disentangle rather than to cut the knot, at least of anybody feels who is working with any thread, so anybody feels who is working with any tool<span class="comma">,</span> so anybody feels who is writing any sentence<span class="comma">,</span> or reading it after it<span class="comma">,</span> has been written. And what does a comma do<span class="question-replace">,</span><span class="question">?</span> <span class="question-replace">a</span><span class="question">A</span> comma does nothing but make easy a thing that<span class="comma">,</span> if you like it enough<span class="comma">,</span> is easy enough without the comma. A long<span class="comma">,</span> complicated sentence should force itself upon you, make you know yourself knowing it<span class="comma">,</span> and the comma, well at the most<span class="comma">,</span> a comma is a poor period that lets you stop and take a breath<span class="comma">,</span> but if you want to take a breath<span class="comma">,</span> you ought to know yourself<span class="colon">:</span> that you want to take a breath. It is not like stopping altogether has something to do with going on, but taking a breath<span class="comma">,</span> well you are always taking a breath<span class="comma">,</span> and why emphasize one breath rather than another breath<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span> Anyway<span class="comma">,</span> that is the way I felt about it<span class="comma">,</span> and I felt that about it very very strongly. And so<span class="comma">,</span> I almost never used a comma. The longer, the more complicated the sentence<span class="comma">,</span> the greater the number of the same kinds of words I had following one after another, the more<span class="comma">,</span> the very more I had of them<span class="comma">,</span> the more I felt the passionate need of their taking care of themselves<span class="comma">,</span> by themselves and not helping them, and thereby enfeebling them by putting in a comma.

    <br><br>So that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose<span class="exclamation-replace">,</span><span class="exclamation">!</span> <span class="exclamation-replace">i</span><span class="exclamation">I</span>n poetry it is a little different<span class="comma">,</span> but more so<span class="comma">,</span> and later<span class="comma">,</span> I will go into that. But that is the way I felt about punctuation in prose.
