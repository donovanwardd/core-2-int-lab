<p>I have refused them so often<span class="comma">,</span> and left the out so much<span class="comma">,</span> and did without them so continually that I have come finally to be indifferent to them. I do not now care whether you put them in or not<span class="comma">,</span> but for a long time I felt very definitely about them and would have nothing to do with them.

    <br><br>As I say<span class="colon">:</span> commas are servile and they have no life of their own, and their use is not a use, it is a way of replacing one’s own interest<span class="period">.</span><span class="period-replace"> a</span><span class="period"> A</span>nd I do decidedly like to like my own interest<span class="comma">,</span> my own interest<span class="comma">,</span> in what I am doing. A comma<span class="comma">,</span> by helping you along<span class="comma">,</span> holding your coat for you<span class="comma">,</span> and putting on your shoes<span class="comma">,</span> keeps you from living your life as actively as you should lead it<span class="comma">,</span> and to me<span class="comma">,</span> for many years<span class="comma">,</span> and I still do feel that way about it<span class="comma">,</span> only now I do not pay as much attention to them<span class="semicolon-replace">,</span><span class="semicolon">;</span> the use of them was positively degrading. Let me tell you what I feel<span class="comma">,</span> and what I mean<span class="comma">,</span> and what I felt<span class="comma">,</span> and what I meant.
    
    <br><br>When I was writing those long sentences of The Making of Americans, verbs<span class="comma">,</span> active present verbs<span class="comma">,</span> with long dependent adverbial clauses<span class="comma">,</span> became a passion with me. I have told you that I recognize verbs and adverbs aided by prepositions and conjunctions with pronouns as possessing the whole of the active life of writing.
