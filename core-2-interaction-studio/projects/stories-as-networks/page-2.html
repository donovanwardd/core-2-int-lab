<p>So there are the uninteresting things in punctuation<span class="comma">,</span> uninteresting in a way that is perfectly obvious, and so we do not have to go any farther into that. There are<span class="comma">,</span> besides dashes and dots, and these might be interesting spaces<span class="comma">,</span> might be interesting. They might<span class="comma">,</span> if one felt that way about them. <br><br> One other little punctuation mark one can have feelings about<span class="colon">:</span> <span class="colon-replace">and</span> that is the apostrophe for possession. Well feel as you like about that, I can see<span class="comma">,</span> and I do see<span class="comma">,</span> that for many<span class="comma">,</span>that for some<span class="comma">,</span> the possessive case apostrophe has a gentle<span class="comma">,</span> tender insinuation that makes it very difficult to definitely decide to do without it. One does do without it, I do, I mostly always do, but I cannot deny that from time to time I feel myself having regrets<span class="comma">,</span> and from time to time<span class="comma">,</span> I put it in to make the possessive case. I absolutely do not like it<span class="comma">,</span> and leaving it out I feel no regret<span class="semicolon-replace">,</span><span class="semicolon">;</span> there it is unnecessary and not ornamental<span class="comma">,</span> but inside a word and its <span class="quotation">"</span>s<span class="quotation">"</span><span class="comma">,</span> well perhaps, perhaps it does appeal by its weakness to your weakness. At least<span class="comma">,</span> at any rate<span class="comma">,</span> from time to time<span class="comma">,</span> I do find myself letting it alone if it has come in<span class="comma">,</span> and sometimes it has come in. I cannot positively deny<span class="comma">,</span> but that I do<span class="comma">,</span> from time to time<span class="comma">,</span> let it come in.<span class="next-arrow"><a href="https://donovanwardd.github.io/core-2-int-lab/core-2-interaction-studio/projects/stories-as-networks/page-3">&nbsp‚ü∂</a></span></p>
