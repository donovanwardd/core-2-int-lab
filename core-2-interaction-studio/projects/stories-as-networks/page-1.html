<p>There are some punctuations that are interesting and there are some punctuations that are not. Let us begin with the punctuations that are not<span class="colon-replace">.</span> <span class="colon">:</span> <span class="colon-replace">O</span><span class="colon">o</span>f these<span class="comma">,</span> the one<span class="comma">,</span> but the first<span class="comma">,</span> and the most<span class="comma">,</span> the completely most<span class="comma">,</span> uninteresting is the question mark. The question mark is alright when it is all alone<span class="comma">,</span> when it is used as a brand on cattle or when it could be used in decoration<span class="comma">,</span> but connected with writing<span class="comma">,</span> it is completely<span class="comma">,</span> entirely<span class="comma">,</span> completely<span class="comma">,</span> uninteresting. It is evident that is you ask a question<span class="semicolon">;</span> you ask a question but anybody who can read at all knows when a question is a question<span class="comma">,</span> as it is written in writing. Therefore I ask you<span class="period">.</span> <span class="period-replace">t</span><span class="period">T</span>herefore<span class="comma">,</span> wherefore<span class="comma">,</span> should one use the question mark<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span> Beside<span class="comma">,</span> it does not in its form go with ordinary printing and so it pleases neither the eye<span class="comma">,</span> nor the ear<span class="comma">,</span> and it is therefore like a noun, just an unnecessary name of something. A question is a question, anybody can know that a question is a question<span class="comma">,</span> and so why add to it<span class="comma">,</span> the question mark<span class="comma">,</span> when it is already there<span class="question">?</span> <span class="question-replace">w</span><span class="question">W</span>hen the question is already there in the writing<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span> Therefore<span class="comma">,</span> I never could bring myself to use a question mark<span class="period-replace">,</span><span class="period">.</span> I always found it positively revolting, and now very few do use it. Exclamation marks have the same difficulty<span class="comma">,</span> and also quotation marks<span class="period-replace">,</span><span class="period">.</span> <span class="period-replace">t</span><span class="period">T</span>hey are unnecessary<span class="exclamation-replace">,</span><span class="exclamation">!</span> <span class="exclamation-replace">t</span><span class="exclamation">T</span>hey are ugly<span class="exclamation-replace">,</span><span class="exclamation">!</span> <span class="exclamation-replace">t</span><span class="exclamation">T</span>hey spoil the line of the writing or the printing<span class="exclamation">!</span> <span class="exclamation-replace">a</span><span class="exclamation">A</span>nd anyway what is the use<span class="question-replace">,</span><span class="question">?</span><span class="question-replace">i</span><span class="question"> I</span>f you do not know that a question is a question<span class="comma">,</span> what is the use of its being a question<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span> The same thing is true of a quotation. When I first began writing<span class="comma">,</span> I found it simply impossible to use question marks<span class="comma">,</span> and quotation marks<span class="comma">,</span> and exclamation points<span class="comma">,</span> and now anybody sees it that way. Perhaps some day they will see it some other way<span class="comma">,</span> but not at any rate anybody can<span class="comma">,</span> and does see it that way. <span class="next-arrow"><a href="https://donovanwardd.github.io/core-2-int-lab/core-2-interaction-studio/projects/stories-as-networks/page-2">&nbsp‚ü∂</a></span></p>
