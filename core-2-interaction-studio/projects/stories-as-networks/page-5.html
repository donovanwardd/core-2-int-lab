<p>You can see what an entirely different thing a period is from a comma, a colon<span class="comma">,</span> or a semi-colon.

    <br><br>There are two different way of thinking about colons and semicolons<span class="colon">:</span> you can think of them as commas<span class="comma">,</span> and as such they are purely servile<span class="comma">,</span> or you can think of them as periods<span class="comma">,</span> and then using them can make you feel adventurous<span class="semicolon">;</span> I can see that one might feel about them as periods<span class="comma">,</span> but I myself never have<span class="period-replace">,</span><span class="period">.</span> I began<span class="comma">,</span> unfortunately<span class="comma">,</span> to feel them as a comma<span class="comma">,</span> and commas are servile<span class="period">.</span> <span class="period-replace">t</span><span class="period">T</span>hey have no life of their own<span class="period">.</span> <span class="period-replace">t</span><span class="period">T</span>hey are dependent upon use<span class="comma">,</span> and convenience<span class="comma">,</span> and they are put there just for practical purposes. Semi-colons and colons had<span class="comma">,</span> for me<span class="comma">,</span> from the first<span class="comma">,</span> completely<span class="comma">,</span> this character<span class="comma">,</span> the character that a comma has<span class="comma">,</span> and not the character that a period has<span class="comma">,</span> and therefore<span class="comma">,</span> and definitely<span class="comma">,</span> I have never used them. But now<span class="comma">,</span> dimly and definitely<span class="comma">,</span> I do see that they might<span class="comma">,</span> well possibly<span class="comma">,</span> they might have in them something of the character of the period<span class="comma">,</span> and so it might have been an adventure to use them. I really do not think so. I think however lively they are<span class="comma">,</span> or disguised they are they are definitely more comma than period<span class="comma">,</span> and so really I cannot regret not having used them<span class="exclamation-replace">.</span><span class="exclamation">!</span> They are more powerful<span class="comma">,</span> more imposing<span class="comma">,</span> more pretentious<span class="comma">,</span> than a comma<span class="comma">,</span> but they are a comma all the same. They really have within them deeply within them<span class="comma">,</span> fundamentally within them<span class="comma">,</span> the comma nature. And now<span class="comma">,</span> what does a comma do<span class="comma">,</span> and what has it to do<span class="comma">,</span> and why do I feel as I do about them<span class="question-replace">.</span><span class="question">?</span>
