       <h1>Documenting Interactive Work</h1>

        <p>This website, titled “On Punctuation…” is based on the text by Gertrude Stein of the same name, taking the original text, and adding an interactive element as a commentary on the content of the text. The original writing divulges into Stein's thoughts on punctuation, and more specifically, her aversion to using punctuation wherever she feels it to be unnecessary. The website takes the text, which has a distinct lack of punctuation, and gives the user the ability to add punctuation, making for a personalized reading experience that allows the users to decide for themselves if the punctuation is truly necessary or not. To make the text as legible as possible, I used black Helvetica type on a white background, which was able to pair well with the colorful punctuations, making the focal point of the website unmistakable.</p>
