    <p>
        After reading A Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina, I think that one of the most interesting points she raised was about how the algorithms of search engines push older websites to the wayside because they are usually less useful to the user than refined and up-to-date sites; however, I believe that this is somewhat destructive to the records of internet history, and reaffirms why archives preserving early webpages are important. I think many early websites can be used as reference points for people to be able to compare the current internet to the years just after its inception, but also for a revitalisation of the aesthetic qualities, as some of the old styles may be harkened back to in the future. The use of archives, or at least having an avenue through which these websites are more accessible, would be a method to avoid restraining creativity for future designers looking to capture the inexperience of the early internet.

        My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? by Laurel Schwulst mentioned how an individual who creates a website is both the author and architect, which I agree with, as websites could almost be considered an exhibition of a topic. I think it is important for artists to have control over not only their content, but also how that content in presented, and websites provide the opportunity for both, so that both elements have as much weight and cohesion as the creator would like. I felt as though many of the metaphors the author used could be related by how ever-changing and malleable websites are, and how there is always the opportunity to tear down, reconstruct, or completely change a website. Also, I think that websites are ultimately extensions of the creator or creators, and the article served as a reminder that the power is within the individuals hands to make the changes to, or construct, a website in-line with their desires.
