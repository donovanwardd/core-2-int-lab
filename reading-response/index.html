    <p>
        After reading A Vernacular Web by Olia Lialina, I think that one of the most interesting points she raised was about how the algorithms of search engines push older websites to the wayside because they are usually less useful to the user than refined and up-to-date sites; however, I believe that this is somewhat destructive to the records of internet history, and reaffirms why archives preserving early webpages are important. I think many early websites can be used as reference points for people to be able to compare the current internet to the years just after its inception, but also for a revitalisation of the aesthetic qualities, as some of the old styles may be harkened back to in the future. The use of archives, or at least having an avenue through which these websites are more accessible, would be a method to avoid restraining creativity for future designers looking to capture the inexperience of the early internet.

        My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be? by Laurel Schwulst mentioned how an individual who creates a website is both the author and architect, which I agree with, as websites could almost be considered an exhibition of a topic. I think it is important for artists to have control over not only their content, but also how that content in presented, and websites provide the opportunity for both, so that both elements have as much weight and cohesion as the creator would like. I felt as though many of the metaphors the author used could be related by how ever-changing and malleable websites are, and how there is always the opportunity to tear down, reconstruct, or completely change a website. Also, I think that websites are ultimately extensions of the creator or creators, and the article served as a reminder that the power is within the individuals hands to make the changes to, or construct, a website in-line with their desires.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">Typography and the Screen</span> by <span class="author">Loretta Staples</span></h2>

    <p>
        <b>Summary:</b> In Typography and the Screen, the author discusses the development of typography through following the Macintosh platform, among contemporaries, and accompanying technologies developing at the time. Typography, with its newfound relationship to the screen, had some difficulties when translating to print, as early printing methods such as dot-matrix left the type with a downgrade in visual quality. Printing was fairly more accurate with the creation of the LaserWriter, as it could print around 300 dots-per-inch, and also came with Adobe Systems’ PostScript, a program that made it possible to arrange text and images on a page. Bitmap typefaces designed specifically for the screen, such the Macintosh fonts Chicago and Geneva, led to the creation of fonts for both the page and the screen, such as METAFONT and Lucidia. From there, more typefaces for the screen began to be developed around the mid 1980’s, with Zuzanna Licko creating the fonts Emperor, Oakland, and Emigre, and designers such as April Greiman, began to experiment with the idea of placing the pixilated, screen-ready type, on a printed medium. Many fonts at the time were still mostly made of bitmaps from existing fonts and not specifically designed for the screen, which led to companies such as Apple creating dedicated digital fonts, as did Adobe Systems around the same time. With Adobe Photoshop being created in 1990, software started to take advantage of the access to color and antialiasing, culminating in being able to edit photographs. With the World Wide Web, designers used Photoshop to make type into graphic files, in addition to a company named @Home providing services that would let people use the fonts they provided in HTML. In 1996, a program called OpenType would embed fonts into HTML documents, although development was slow.

        <b> Response and Questions:</b> After reading through Typography and the Screen by Loretta Staples, I felt like I have a more developed understanding of the history of typography's interaction with technological advances. The back-and-forth nature of developing type only for the screen, and then type that could be both printed and viewed on the screen was interesting to see, as it was a melding between two eras that the leading web design companies had to constitute and control. Some questions I have are: Did the development of technology change the fundamental process for creating typefaces? Is it essential for all typefaces to be designed for both the screen and for print? Will there be a need for typefaces to be created for printing purposes in the future?
